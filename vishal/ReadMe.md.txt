Installation
1. install npm, nodeJS
2. install create-react-app from https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app
3. run command "npx create-react-app <app_name> --template typescript"  as npx create-react-app demo --template typescript
   This will create a react project with name "demo" with default file structure.
4. run "npm start"
   app will be running on http://localhost:3000.


index.tsx
   it is a starting point of a react app. 
   A default component named "App" is created with the "create-react-app" and is used in the index.tsx.
   
   There are 4 types of components. will be explained later.
   
APP.tsx
  usually the very first component of the application.
  
  All the functions created are the Components.
  We use arrow functions style to define a function.
  
  App = () => {
    return{
	  <div></div>
	}
  }
  
  every component MUST return ONE and ONLY ONE HTML tag.
  *css class is renamed to className.
  
  <div className="<className>"></div>

pure functions => 
  Are the functions which do not reflect its value to the UI.
  in old react (before v-16) it was called as pure function/ function component.
